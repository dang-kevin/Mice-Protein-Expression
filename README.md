# Unsupervised Learning Protein Expression
 Unsupervised learning methods on the [Mice Protein Expression Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Unsupervised-Learning-Protein-Expression.Rmd is an R Markdown file containing the code and analysis. Unsupervised-Learning-Protein-Expression.pdf contains the output of the analysis in a scientific paper format for easier reading.

The unsupervised learning methods used in this analysis include hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and partitioning around medoids, and principal component analysis.
